# ammar.nvim
## Introduction
This repository contains my personalized setup for Neovim. Inspired by ThePrimeagen and kickstart.nvim.

## Features
- **Lua**: Leverages the power of the Lua language for configuration
- **Modern Plugins**: Pluging management with packer, telescope for fuzzy finding, treesitter and lsp.zero for syntax highlighting and language support
- **Clean Aesthetics**: Dracula theme with removed background
- **Efficient Keymaps**: `&#9251; h` to return to the file finder, `&#9251; ff` to search project files, `&#9251; sf` to search for a query in project files, etc.

> [!NOTE]    
> **NOT** a Neovim distribution, simply a configuration.
